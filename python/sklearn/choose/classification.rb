Decision Trees
  easy to understand
  Fastest way to identify most significant variables and relation between two or more variables.
  choose between among courses of action

  Usage:
    Investment decisions
    Customer churn
    Banks loan defaulters
    Build vs Buy decisions
    Company mergers decisions
    Sales lead qualifications

Logistic Regression:
  binary

  Usage:
    Predicting the Customer Churn
    Credit Scoring & Fraud Detection
    Measuring the effectiveness of marketing campaigns

SVM, Support Vector Machines
  widely used in pattern recognition and classification problems – when your data has exactly two classes.
  In general, SVM can be used in real-world applications such as:
  Usage:
    detecting persons with common diseases such as diabetes
    hand-written character recognition
    text categorization – news articles by topics
    stock market price prediction

Naive Bayes:
  simple, easy, useful for very large data sets.
  good choice when CPU and memory resources

  Usage:
    Sentiment analysis and text classification
    Recommendation systems like Netflix, Amazon
    To mark an email as spam or not spam
    Facebook like face recognition

Random Forest:
  is an ensemble of decision trees.
  work for regression and classification
  work with large data sets.
  identify most significant variables from thousands of input variables.


  Usage:
    Predict patients for high risks
    Predict parts failures in manufacturing
    Predict loan defaulters

Apriori
  This algorithm generates association rules from a given data set. Association rule implies that if an item A occurs, then item B also occurs with a certain probability.
  In general, Apriori can be used in real-world applications such as:

  Market basket analysis like amazon – products purchased together
  Auto complete functionality like Google to provide words which come together
  Identify Drugs and their effects on patients
